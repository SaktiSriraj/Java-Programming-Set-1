# Java-Programming-Set-1

<ol>
<li>Write a java program to count the number of bits that are set 1 in an
integer. Also prove that time complexity is O(n) where n is the number
of bits.</li> 

<li>Write a program to find the parity bit of a number in O(n) time, where
n is the word size.</li>

<li>Write a program to find the parity bit of a number in O(k) time, where
k is the number of set bits.</li>

<li>Write a program to find the parity bit of a number in O(k) time, where
k is the number of set bits.</li>

<li>Define a function to create a lookup table of size 216 whose value is the
parity bits of the index.</li>

<li>Write a program to calculate the parity bit of a 64-bit word using look-up
table in O(n/L) time, where n is the word size and L is the group size.
Note: Consider group size is 16-bit for the problem.</li>

<li>Write a program to calculate the parity bit of a 64-bit word using only xor
and the right shift operator.</li>

<li>Write a program to swap the ith bit with jth bit of a number.</li>

<li>Design a function to create a lookup table A such that for every 16-bit
number y, A[y] holds the bit-reversal of y.</li>

<li>Write a program to find the bit reversal of a number using the lookup
table created in Q9.</li>

<li>Write a program to find the closest integer with the same weight.</li>
<li>Write a program to compute XXY using a bitwise operator.<.li>
<li>Write a program to compute X/Y using a bitwise operator.</li>
<li>Write a program to compute XY using a bitwise operator./li>
<li>Write a program to check if a decimal number is a palindrome.</li>
<li>Write a program that test if two rectangles have a nonempty intersection. If the intersection is nonempty, return the rectangle formed by their
intersection</li>
